# Task-1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This task involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. The analysis will help uncover patterns, relationships, and potential data issues before proceeding with further modeling or decision-making.

## Steps in EDA

### 1. Overview of the Data
- Load the dataset and examine its structure.
- Check the number of rows and columns.
- Identify data types of each feature.

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max values.
- Analyze the distribution shape of numerical features.

### 3. Distribution of Numerical Features
- Visualize the distribution using histograms and density plots.
- Identify patterns, skewness, and potential outliers.

### 4. Distribution of Categorical Features
- Analyze the frequency and variability of categorical variables.
- Use bar plots and count plots for visualization.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
- Compute correlation coefficients between numerical features.
- Visualize relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots.

### 6. Identifying Missing Values
- Detect missing values in the dataset.
- Decide on appropriate imputation strategies (mean, median, mode, or predictive models).

### 7. Outlier Detection
- Use box plots to identify and visualize outliers.
- Decide whether to remove or transform extreme values.

## Tools & Libraries
The following Python libraries will be used for analysis:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
- `scipy` for statistical analysis
```

## Expected Outcomes
- A detailed understanding of dataset structure.
- Identification of missing values and outliers.
- Insights into feature relationships and distributions.
- Prepared data ready for preprocessing and modeling.

By conducting EDA, we ensure that data quality issues are addressed and gain insights that help improve model performance and decision-making.
